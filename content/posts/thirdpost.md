Welcome back.

I've decided to show up.

I've picked this blog back up. Also checkout the new theme. I used to be apart of a community that skinned applications way the fuck back in the early 2000s. That community had a lot of overlap with the Litestep community for obvious reason. FPNs blog was one I frequented often to get news. So I ripped it off for my blog. I think it looks pretty cool.

I made a theme in [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based on FPN. With all the goodness that a modern framework provides.

I'll be adding more links and of course more posts. Still in the realm of tech but I'll probably post about anything.

I wanted to have a space outside of social media sites just to not be controlled by them. I'm sure you can understand.

Anyway, talk to you soon.
